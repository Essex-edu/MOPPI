# Microsoft Office Professional Plus Installer
M.O.P.P.I. (aka [MOPPI](https://github.com/nyhtml/MOPPI)) is a project that uses a text-based user interface to provide automated installation and activation of Microsoft Office Professional Plus. Currently, Microsoft Office products utilize Click-to-Run technology instead of a  Windows Installer (MSI), so MOPPI takes full advantage of this in the command-line interface of the Windows Operating System for a simple installation and activation.
