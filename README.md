# M.O.P.P.I - Microsoft Office Professional Plus Initiator
M.O.P.P.I (aka [MOPPI](https://github.com/nyhtml/MOPPI/)) is a project that uses a text-based user interface to provide automated installation and activation of Microsoft Office Professional Plus. Currently, Microsoft Office products utilize Click-to-Run technology instead of Windows Installer (MSI) so MOPPI takes full advantage of this in the command-line interface of the Windows Operating System for a simple installation.
